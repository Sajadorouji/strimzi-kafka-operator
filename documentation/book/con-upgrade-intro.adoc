[id='con-upgrade-intro-{context}']
Newer versions of {ProductName} may support newer versions of Kafka, but you need to upgrade {ProductName} _before_ you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.

{ProductName} can be upgraded with no cluster downtime. Each version of {ProductName} supports one or more versions of Apache Kafka: you can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of {ProductName}.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

.Upgrade process outline

Upgrading {ProductName} is a two-stage process. To upgrade brokers and clients without downtime, you _must_ complete the upgrade procedures in the following order:

. Update your Cluster Operator to the latest {ProductName} version.

. Upgrade all Kafka brokers and client applications to the latest Kafka version.
** xref:assembly-upgrading-kafka-versions-{context}[]
